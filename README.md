# Replace Vite with Mix in Laravel 9.2

If you are starting a Laravel 9.2 project and donâ€™t want to use Vite you can easily remove it and revert back to Laravel Mix.

Start by adding the following to your project root directory webpack.mix.js

```php
const mix = require('laravel-mix');

/*
 |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Mix Asset Management
 |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 |
 | Mix provides a clean, fluent API for defining some Webpack build steps
 | for your Laravel application. By default, we are compiling the Sass
 | file for the application as well as bundling up all the JS files.
 |
 */

mix.js('resources/js/app.js', 'public/js')
    .sass('resources/sass/app.scss', 'public/css')
    .sourceMaps();
```

Then modify your package.json file:

```Original```
```php
"scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build"
},
```

```Modified```
```php
"scripts": {
    "dev": "npm run development",
    "development": "mix",
    "watch": "mix watch",
    "watch-poll": "mix watch -- --watch-options-poll=1000",
    "hot": "mix watch --hot",
    "prod": "npm run production",
    "production": "mix --production"
},
"devDependencies": {
    "@popperjs/core": "^2.10.2",
    "axios": "^0.25",
    "bootstrap": "^5.1.3",
    "laravel-mix": "^6.0.6",
    "lodash": "^4.17.19",
    "postcss": "^8.1.14",
    "resolve-url-loader": "^5.0.0",
    "sass": "^1.32.11",
    "sass-loader": "^11.0.1"
}
```

That should be it. Now you can run npm run dev or npm run development etc. to use Laravel Mix.
